    "As we discussed this morning, showers of high energy protons called \"cosmic rays\" rain down on our solar system from outer space all the time, from every direction. When these cosmic rays hit the dense air in our atmosphere, they interact, producing many other long lived particles. Our detectors have been observing these for 100 years!\n",
    "\n",
    "We also saw this morning that a thick material (like a sheet of plastic) can block many of these particles. Because the moon is close to us and very very dense, it can block cosmic rays from reaching our detectors! \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, by looking for a *reduction* in the number of events in a particular direction, we can \"see\" the moon. This was the first kind of astrophysics IceCube could do!\n",
